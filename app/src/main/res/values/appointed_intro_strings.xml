    <string name="sergeantIntro">
        The function of the Sergeant-at-Arms is to help maintain an orderly, dignified, and effective Rotaract club meeting. The Sergeant should be constantly on the alert to prevent any occurrence that might detract from the meeting. While maintaining order at meetings the Sergeant also raises funds for the club by fining members who breach protocol or standout at meetings in fun and humorous ways. The Sergeant may fine members for not wearing their Rotaract pin, being inappropriately dressed at meetings, talking during meeting, receiving an award or performing exceptionally in their duties, or even for trivial reasons as long as it is done with good taste and humour. Fines go towards the administrative cost of the club. The Sergeant-at-arms must also ensure that someone fulfils their duties or not in the event of absences.
